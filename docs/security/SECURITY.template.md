# Security Policy & Incident Response Plan

## Our Security Commitment

The [PROJECT_NAME] team takes security seriously. We appreciate responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities and are committed to working with security researchers to keep our project secure.

This document outlines our security policy, incident response procedures, and how to report vulnerabilities.

## Scope

This security policy applies to vulnerabilities discovered within the `[REPOSITORY_NAME]` repository. The scope includes:

- [List specific components, modules, or features]
- [Example: Core application code and configurations]
- [Example: API endpoints and authentication systems]
- [Example: Database schemas and data handling]
- [Example: Build and deployment processes]

### Out of Scope

The following are considered **out of scope** for this policy:

- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies already publicly disclosed
- Issues requiring physical access or compromised credentials
- Social engineering attacks
- [Add project-specific exclusions]

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| [X.Y.Z] | :white_check_mark: |
| [X.Y-1] | :x:                |

## Incident Response

- **Report Security Issues**: `[SECURITY_EMAIL]`
- **Initial Response**: Within [RESPONSE_TIME]
- **Critical Issues**: Escalated immediately to maintainers

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**⚠️ DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Report to: **`[SECURITY_EMAIL]`**

### Include in Your Report

1. **Description**: Clear explanation of the vulnerability and impact
2. **Steps to Reproduce**: Minimal steps to demonstrate the issue
3. **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots if applicable
4. **Affected Version**: Branch or commit hash
5. **Suggested Fix**: Optional recommendations

## Incident Response Process

### Severity Classification

| Level             | Description                   | Examples                                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Critical (P0)** | Immediate threat to all users | Remote code execution, authentication bypass, data breach |
| **High (P1)**     | Significant security impact   | Privilege escalation, data exposure, XSS in auth flows    |
| **Medium (P2)**   | Limited security impact       | XSS in non-critical areas, CSRF vulnerabilities           |
| **Low (P3)**      | Minor security issues         | Information disclosure, security misconfigurations        |

### Response Timeline

| Severity | Initial Response | Fix Target  | Disclosure   |
| -------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Critical | 2 days           | 14 days     | Upon patch   |
| High     | 3 days           | 30 days     | Upon patch   |
| Medium   | 5 days           | 60 days     | Upon patch   |
| Low      | 7 days           | Best effort | With release |

### Incident Response Phases

#### Phase 1: Detection & Analysis

- Acknowledge receipt and assign tracking ID
- Validate and reproduce vulnerability
- Assess severity and impact
- Notify team if critical

#### Phase 2: Containment

- Implement temporary mitigations
- Document affected components
- Begin fix development
- Prepare communication plan

#### Phase 3: Remediation

- Develop and test permanent fix
- Prepare security patch
- Request CVE if appropriate
- Coordinate disclosure timeline

#### Phase 4: Recovery & Disclosure

- Release patched version
- Publish security advisory
- Update documentation
- Credit reporter

#### Phase 5: Post-Incident Review

- Document lessons learned
- Update security practices
- Improve detection
- Update policies

## Communication Expectations

- All communications via email
- Regular updates throughout process
- Clear explanation if not a vulnerability
- Confidentiality until patched

## Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted in good faith to be:

- Authorized under applicable laws
- Exempt from Terms of Service restrictions
- Protected from legal action

Requirements for safe harbor:

- Follow this policy
- Report responsibly
- Avoid privacy violations
- No exploitation beyond demonstration

## Recognition

We value security researchers' contributions:

- Public credit in advisories (unless anonymous)
- Security acknowledgments
- Letter of appreciation upon request

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Essential Security Measures

1. **Secret Management**
   - Never commit secrets to version control
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Implement secret rotation
   - Enable secret scanning

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement proper session management
   - Use strong password policies
   - Enable multi-factor authentication
   - Regular auth system updates

3. **Dependencies**
   - Regular security audits
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Review licenses and advisories
   - Use dependency scanning tools

4. **Deployment**
   - HTTPS everywhere
   - Proper CORS policies
   - Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
   - Regular security assessments

5. **Code Security**
   - Input validation
   - Output encoding
   - Parameterized queries
   - Principle of least privilege
