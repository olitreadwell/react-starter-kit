# Security Incident Response Playbook

This playbook provides step-by-step procedures for handling security incidents in React Starter Kit projects. Each procedure includes specific actions, tools, and decision criteria.

## Quick Reference

- **Security Email**: `security@kriasoft.com`
- **Incident Tracking**: GitHub Security Advisories
- **Communication Channel**: Email (encrypted when possible)
- **Escalation**: Project maintainers via GitHub

## Incident Classification

### Determining Severity

Use this decision tree to classify incidents:

```
Is remote code execution possible?
├─ Yes → CRITICAL (P0)
└─ No → Can authentication be bypassed?
    ├─ Yes → CRITICAL (P0)
    └─ No → Is sensitive data exposed?
        ├─ Yes (all users) → CRITICAL (P0)
        ├─ Yes (subset) → HIGH (P1)
        └─ No → Is privilege escalation possible?
            ├─ Yes → HIGH (P1)
            └─ No → Is XSS present?
                ├─ Yes (auth flow) → HIGH (P1)
                ├─ Yes (other) → MEDIUM (P2)
                └─ No → Is CSRF possible?
                    ├─ Yes → MEDIUM (P2)
                    └─ No → LOW (P3)
```

## Phase 1: Initial Response

### Step 1.1: Acknowledge Report (0-2 hours)

**Actions:**

1. Send acknowledgment email with template:

   ```
   Subject: [RSK-SEC-YYYY-NNN] Security Report Received

   Thank you for your security report. We have received your submission
   and assigned tracking ID: RSK-SEC-YYYY-NNN

   We will begin our initial assessment and respond within [TIMEFRAME].

   Please keep this vulnerability confidential while we investigate.
   ```

2. Create private GitHub issue for tracking
3. Assign initial responder

**Tools:** Email client, GitHub Issues (private)

### Step 1.2: Initial Assessment (2-24 hours)

**Actions:**

1. Review report for completeness
2. Attempt to reproduce vulnerability
3. Determine affected components
4. Classify severity using decision tree

**Decision Points:**

- If cannot reproduce � Request clarification
- If critical � Immediately notify maintainers
- If valid � Proceed to Phase 2

### Step 1.3: Form Response Team

**For Critical/High severity:**

- Lead: Project maintainer
- Developer: Fix implementation
- Reviewer: Code review and testing
- Communicator: External updates

**For Medium/Low severity:**

- Developer: Fix implementation

## Phase 2: Investigation & Containment

### Step 2.1: Deep Dive Analysis (Day 1-2)

**Actions:**

1. Set up isolated test environment

3. Identify root cause
4. Document attack vectors
5. Check for similar vulnerabilities

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Vulnerability reproduced
- [ ] Root cause identified
- [ ] Attack surface mapped
- [ ] Similar code patterns checked
- [ ] Impact assessment complete

### Step 2.2: Temporary Mitigation (If Critical)

**Actions:**

1. Develop temporary workaround
2. Test workaround doesn't break functionality
3. Document workaround for users
4. Publish security bulletin with mitigation

**Template for Security Bulletin:**

```markdown
## Security Bulletin: [TITLE]

**Date**: [DATE]
**Severity**: [CRITICAL/HIGH]
**Status**: Under Investigation

### Summary

We are investigating a security vulnerability in React Starter Kit.

### Temporary Mitigation

Until a patch is available, users should:

1. [Specific mitigation steps]
2. [Additional steps]

### Timeline

- Patch expected: [DATE]
- Full disclosure: After patch

### Contact

Report issues to: `security@kriasoft.com`
```

## Phase 3: Development & Testing

### Step 3.1: Develop Fix (Varies by severity)

**Actions:**

1. Create private branch for fix
2. Implement minimal fix (no refactoring)
3. Add regression tests
4. Document code changes

**Code Review Checklist:**

- [ ] Fix addresses root cause
- [ ] No new vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] Tests cover vulnerability scenario
- [ ] Changes are minimal and focused
- [ ] No sensitive info in comments/commits

### Step 3.2: Testing Protocol

**Test Environments:**

1. Local development
2. Isolated staging
3. Integration testing
4. Performance impact

**Test Cases:**

- [ ] Original PoC no longer works
- [ ] Legitimate functionality preserved
- [ ] No performance regression
- [ ] No new error conditions
- [ ] Edge cases handled

### Step 3.3: Prepare Release

**Actions:**

1. Update version numbers
2. Write release notes
3. Prepare security advisory
4. Request CVE (if applicable)

**CVE Request Template:**

```
